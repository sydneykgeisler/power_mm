Description: Given an exemplary dataset, the power_mm function computes a power
    approximation for any number of fixed effects specified in the model. Unlike
    the lme4 package, this function can take on variance components for each random
    effect and essentially hold them constant within the model. This function is
    currently only available for exemplary data following the Gaussian distribution.
